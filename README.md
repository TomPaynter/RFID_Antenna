# RFID Antenna

This is a KiCAD PCB project of the antenna described in the Texas Instruments' Application Report SLOA135A: **Antenna Matching for the TRF7960 RFID Reader** (http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa135a/sloa135a.pdf) and is also here in the repo.

Some of the component values are different, this was found by analysing a prototype antenna on a network analyser.

# Questions/Comments/Abuse
All genuine Questions/Comments/Abuse would be greatly appreciated. I am by no means a PCB engineer and would like to learn. 

If you like/use the work, it would be great to see a little star, Cheers!
